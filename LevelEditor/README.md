OFSONIC Level Editor - v0.1a
=============

About
-----
OFLED is a level editor for tile-based platformers, highly inspired on my
Oficina Framework clone of a Sonic The Hedgehog engine, OFSONIC THE HEDGEHOG.

This is based on a template for usage of OficinaFramework and dear imgui, a
lightweight immediate API for debugging your program, developed by Omar Cornut.
You can check out more about this on the [library page](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
